# Covid19-Analysis
Analysis of Covid-19 confirmed cases and death levels.

In this repository we take a look at the effects of Covid 19 pandemic on individual counties in the United States. Using the
SIR epidmec model, we predict the number of confirmed cases in each county of the US. Then, using a Random Forest model, we
predict the severity of the virus's impact a week in the future.

Our findings are detailed in CovidReport.pdf
